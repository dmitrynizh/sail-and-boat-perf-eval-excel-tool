Excel/VB tool for performance evaluation and study of sails and boats including hydrofoils
(c) dmitrynizh 2012-2017

This hobby project was initially created to evaluate and study performance of various windsurfing sails.
The work was done on my home PC's Excel 2007 in the summer of 2012. Polar diagrams and hydrofoil support were added later.
The repository contains various Excel files, one for given sail or sail/board or sail/boat combination.
There is no generic template; to create a new project, grab one that "fits" better, modify and save under new name.
